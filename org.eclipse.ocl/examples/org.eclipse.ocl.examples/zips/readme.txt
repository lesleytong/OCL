This folder is a placeholder for the OCL example project ZIPs

For a Tycho build, the ZIPs are built by a buildZips.xml invocation from maven-antrun in pom.xml.

For interactive Eclipse usage, the buildZips.xml may be run as Run->External Tools->OCL Example ZIPs.
The OCL Example ZIPs should run automatically when the project is built.
