OCL embedded in Ecore can be executed with either the Classic evaluator or the new Pivot evaluator depending on the URI used to define the embedded EAnnotations. This preference determines the URI written to Ecore files when no URI was previously in use.

Selecting @http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore/OCL@ makes no choice and so defers to the user's "run-time delegation choice":#DefaultDelegation.

Selecting @http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore/OCL/Pivot@ is recommended since the OCLinEcore editor and Pivot evaluator both use the Xtext parser. This should avoid problems whereby not all facilities of the new Pivot grammar are supported by the Classic grammic or LPG evaluator.

Selecting @http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore/OCL/LPG@ may be appropriate if evaluation using the classic LPG evaluator is important.
