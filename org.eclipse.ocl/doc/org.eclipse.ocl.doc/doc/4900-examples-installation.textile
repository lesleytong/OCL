h2(#Installation). Installing the Eclipse OCL Examples and Editors

These instructions have been updated for Eclipse Mars; Eclipse 4.5, EMF 2.11, OCL 6.0.
* Some screenshots may be slightly out of date.

The OCL User Interface (console, editors, debugger and validity view) 
is not part of the core OCL functionality included in the
Eclipse Modeling Tools Package, so although you may have OCL installed and be able
to read this tutorial via the *Help->Help Contents->OCL Documentation*, you may
not have the OCL examples installed.

An easy way to test whether you have the OCL Examples installed is
to right click on a *.ecore file and see whether
*OCLinEcore Editor* appears in the *Open With* submenu.

If OCL is not installed at all, or if just the examples are not installed,
the following installation step will automatically install the OCL Examples
and all required projects such as *EMF*, *UML2*, *MWE2*, *Xpand*
and *Xtext*.

Left-click on *Help* in the Eclipse menu-bar then left-click on *Install New Software...*
and select the *Luna - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/luna* update site
from the pull-down menu to *Work with* and be patient while the available updates
are identified. Then type *OCL* in the filter text, click on the expand item preceding
the *Modeling* category and then check *OCL Examples and Editors SDK*.

Select *Finish* and be patient while the software is downloaded and installed.
Select *Restart Now* when prompted to do so.

h3. Troubleshooting

Eclipse Modeling Projects have a large number of classes and so require a
large amount of PermGen space on a Sun JVM. If you are using default Eclipse
startup settings you are liable to encounter OutOfMemoryExceptions. Therefore
follow the advice in "How do I start Eclipse":http://wiki.eclipse.org/IRC_FAQ#How_do_I_start_Eclipse.3F
and set XX:PermSize to at least 64M, either on your Eclipse command line, or your
Eclipse shortcut or in the *eclipse.ini* adjacent to *eclipse.exe*. If you are using a 64 bit machine
or plan to use graphical modeling tools such as Papyrus or Sirius, 128M is almost certainly necessary.
